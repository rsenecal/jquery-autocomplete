Autocomplete with HTML and JQueryUI
In this article, we will build an autocomplete input field that will allow the user to select from a list of Marvel characters.

We will only be using Javascript and HTML in this example. The data source will be a static Javascript file {marvelchars.js} with all the names of the Marvel characters. In a future article, I will show how to create a similar autocomplete using the Marvel API.
